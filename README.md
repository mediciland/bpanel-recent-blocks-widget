# Recent Blocks
This is a widget for the bPanel dashboard that displays the top 10 most
recent blocks synced with your node. Rows are expandable giving you more
access to information about the block and includes an easy copy link.

Simply add `'@bpanel/recent-blocks'` to your pluginsConfig.js `plugins`
array, and refresh your bPanel!
